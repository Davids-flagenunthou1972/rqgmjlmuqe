Jus came out from Untl Dawn...wow, what a ride! Still kinda dizzy from the whole experience like being on a ferris wheel made of rusty horror cliches and snow. The theater was freezing, like seriously chill clim8 inside, could barely move wit my jacket as a blanket and old man in corner snoring, coughin like an engine giving up the ghost.

The popcorn everywhere, those crumbs have basically become inhabitants there — feel like they're trying to enact their own horror tale beneath the seats, Popcorn Apocalypse, yeah. Anyway, the movie — jeez. When they went up to that cabin, was like, 'zurely you're havin a laugh' — ya know? But god, those Wendigo effects... like, really? Looked like they were birthed from a Halloween store that got lost in the woods and adopted forest superstitions.

> Jeez, the sound was every where. Peak chaos! Every scream, twig snap, felt them in my spine — ugh, why does fear make my back hurt like an old accordion. So much jump scare chaos too, almost spilled the rest of my fanta for real when that random thing popped up, blinking like it forgot to pay its electricity bill.

There's this part, no spoilers nope, but the way they download the movie-like fear into the whole room! Emotion like pasteboarding pure panic vibes over a group of friends who shld’ve just stayed home and downloaded smth cozier to watch. The characters mostly just wilded out, yknow, like headless chickens, as predictable as pigeons on breadcrumbs.

Random thought, but why do movie cabins always look like someone's idea of a haunted IKEA? Of course, by the end, everyone was either lost, found or turned into memories best left in VHS days. Creepy but comforting in that weird 'you're stuck but it's ok' feeling.

If ur gonna watch the movie, take an extra coat, srsly and maybe a better plot could sneaky sneak inside later like how cats find their way into everything! But somehow, still stuck thinkin about that twisted narrative like trying to untangle noodle hair from someone's soup.

No clue what to make of the last twist, imagination went runaway like a hyperactive puppy in a haunted garden — breathtaking but utterly baffling. OK, g2g bcus my bus is here and my brain can't noodle together anything else.

    while not solved:
        fear = (random.choice(screams))
        chaos.append(fear)
